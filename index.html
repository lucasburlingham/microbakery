			</h2>
			<p>
				First - what is a microbakery (official term: Home Based Vendor)? It's a small-scale business that vends
				foodstuffs directly to consumers within the vendor's state. Vendors are required to comply with local
				health
				and safety regulations, and be certified Food Managers. Microbakeries are often run from home kitchens,
				allowing for lower overhead costs and a more personalized touch to the products offered.
